<ol>
<li>CTI is a routing loop problem happens when the cost of one link in the network increased, and the affected node tell its neighbors to update the distance vector. But its neighbor’s route has the affected node’s old route’s distance. Hence, its neighbor will update its distance again and again until the cost is larger or equal than the current cost of the affected node. If the cost of that link increased to infinity or very large, the loop will continue for a very long time.</li>
<li>It will cost a lot of resources and time for routers updating their link cost for nothing. And this will make the packet transmission slower if the path hasn’t been updated to the right cost. The packets will follow the old path with a high cost to destination.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to avoid this problem, the IEEE 802.11 protocol allows a station to<br>use a short Request to Send (RTS) control frame and a short Clear to Send (CTS)<br>control frame to reserve access to the channel. When a sender wants to send a DATA<br>frame, it can first send an RTS frame to the AP, indicating the total time required<br>to transmit the DATA frame and the acknowledgment (ACK) frame. When the AP<br>receives the RTS frame, it responds by broadcasting a CTS frame.

Suppose RTS and CTS frames were as long as data frames and ACK frames. Would there be any advantage to using them in this case? Why?</h2><blockquote>
<p>• The hidden station problem is mitigated, since a long DATA frame is transmitted<br>only after the channel has been reserved.<br>• Because the RTS and CTS frames are short, a collision involving an RTS or CTS<br>frame will last only for the duration of the short RTS or CTS frame. Once the RTS<br>and CTS frames are correctly transmitted, the following DATA and ACK frames<br>should be transmitted without collisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For this reason, the RTS&#x2F;CTS exchange is<br>only used (if at all) to reserve the channel for the transmission of a long DATA<br>frame. In practice, each wireless station can set an RTS threshold such that the RTS&#x2F;<br>CTS sequence is used only when the frame is longer than the threshold. For many<br>wireless stations, the default RTS threshold value is larger than the maximum frame<br>length, so the RTS&#x2F;CTS sequence is skipped for all DATA frames sent.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>No</li>
<li>The size of the frame is proportional to the probability of a collision</li>
<li>Because RTS and CTS are short, the chance of them causing a collision is low, and collision involving a RTS and CTS frame will last only for the duration of the short RTS or CTS frame.</li>
<li>If RTS and CTS are as long as the standard DATA, then collision will last for longer duration and hence the probability of a collision is higher. And there will be no need to do so. Since, using it will only cause more trouble.</li>

<li>NO.</li>
<li>This two APs can have different SSIDs and MAC addresses. And a wireless stations will associate with one of the APs. After association, there is a virtual link between the new station and APs.

<p><em><strong>Channel partitioning:</strong></em> <br><br>TDM is appealing because it eliminates collisions and is perfectly fair: Each<br>node gets a dedicated transmission rate of R&#x2F;N bps during each frame time. However,<br>it has two major drawbacks. First, a node is limited to an average rate of R&#x2F;N bps<br>even when it is the only node with packets to send. A second drawback is that a node<br>must always wait for its turn in the transmission sequence—again, even when it is<br>the only node with a frame to send.</p>

<li>Channel Partitioning:<ol>
<li>Advantage: It eliminates collisions and is perfectly fair.</li>
<li>Disadvantage: <ol>
<li>A node is limited to an average rate of R&#x2F;N bps, even when it is the only node with packets to send.</li>
<li>A node must always wait for its turn in the transmission sequence. even there is only one node in the sequence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Random Access protocols:</strong></em> <br><br>The second broad class of multiple access protocols are random access protocols.<br>In a random access protocol, a transmitting node always transmits at the full rate<br>of the channel, namely, R bps. When there is a collision, each node involved in the<br>collision repeatedly retransmits its frame (that is, packet) until its frame gets through<br>without a collision. But when a node experiences a collision, it doesn’t necessarily<br>retransmit the frame right away. Instead it waits a random delay before retransmitting<br>the frame. Each node involved in a collision chooses independent random<br>delays. Because the random delays are independently chosen, it is possible that one<br>of the nodes will pick a delay that is sufficiently less than the delays of the other colliding<br>nodes and will therefore be able to sneak its frame into the channel without a<br>collision.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>AD: Every node transmission is at maximum&#x2F;full rate of the channel.</li>
<li>Disadvantage: If in the worst scenario during a collision, more than one nodes wait a same random delay time to retransmit. This condition will cause another collision, and another collision possibly after this collision if this scenario happens again.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Taking-Turns Protocols:</strong></em> <br><br>The first one is the polling protocol. The polling protocol requires one of the<br>nodes to be designated as a master node. The master node polls each of the nodes in<br>a round-robin fashion. In particular, the master node first sends a message to node 1,<br>saying that it (node 1) can transmit up to some maximum number of frames. After node<br>1 transmits some frames, the master node tells node 2 it (node 2) can transmit up to the<br>maximum number of frames. (The master node can determine when a node has finished<br>sending its frames by observing the lack of a signal on the channel.) The procedure continues<br>in this manner, with the master node polling each of the nodes in a cyclic manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The polling protocol eliminates the collisions and empty slots that plague random<br>access protocols. This allows polling to achieve a much higher efficiency. But it also has a few drawbacks. The first drawback is that the protocol introduces a<br>polling delay—the amount of time required to notify a node that it can transmit. If,<br>for example, only one node is active, then the node will transmit at a rate less than<br>R bps, as the master node must poll each of the inactive nodes in turn each time the<br>active node has sent its maximum number of frames. The second drawback, which is<br>potentially more serious, is that if the master node fails, the entire channel becomes<br>inoperative. The Bluetooth protocol, which we will study in Section!6.3, is an example<br>of a polling protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second taking-turns protocol is the token-passing protocol. In this protocol<br>there is no master node. A small, special-purpose frame known as a token is<br>exchanged among the nodes in some fixed order. For example, node 1 might always<br>send the token to node 2, node 2 might always send the token to node 3, and node<br>N might always send the token to node 1. When a node receives a token, it holds<br>onto the token only if it has some frames to transmit; otherwise, it immediately forwards<br>the token to the next node. If a node does have frames to transmit when it<br>receives the token, it sends up to a maximum number of frames and then forwards<br>the token to the next node. Token passing is decentralized and highly efficient. But<br>it has its problems as well. For example, the failure of one node can crash the entire<br>channel. Or if a node accidentally neglects to release the token, then some recovery<br>procedure must be invoked to get the token back in circulation. Over the years many<br>token-passing protocols have been developed, including the fiber distributed data<br>interface (FDDI) protocol [Jain 1994] and the IEEE 802.5 token ring protocol [IEEE<br>802.5 2012], and each one had to address these as well as other sticky issues.</p>
