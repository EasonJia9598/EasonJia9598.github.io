<ol>
<li>CTI is a routing loop problem happens when the cost of one link in the network increased, and the affected node tell its neighbors to update the distance vector. But its neighbor’s route has the affected node’s old route’s distance. Hence, its neighbor will update its distance again and again until the cost is larger or equal than the current cost of the affected node. If the cost of that link increased to infinity or very large, the loop will continue for a very long time.</li>
<li>It will cost a lot of resources and time for routers updating their link cost for nothing. And this will make the packet transmission slower if the path hasn’t been updated to the right cost. The packets will follow the old path with a high cost to destination.</li>
